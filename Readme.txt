Instructions to run the program >
	The Java program can be run from the command line

	steps:-
	1:Open a command promt window and go to the directory where the program is saved
	2:type: 'javac Asn01P01.java' then press enter to compile the program
	3:type: 'java Asn01P01' then press enter, the program will start running

Example invocation and output >
	//after running the program

	Enter the value of M:-							//taking inputs

	1234
	Enter the value of N:-

	1236

	Number is :     1236							//output

	Operations :3
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation >
	the program takes input of two positive integers M and N and prints all those number in between M and N 
	which are perfectly divisible by each of the digits of that number
	As from the above example;
	the two inputs M and N given are : 1234 and 1236 
	1234 is divisible by 1, 2, 3 but not 4 so it is not printed in the output
	1235 is divisible by 1, 3 and 5 but not 2 so it is not printed in the output either
	1236 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 6 and hence it is printed in the output.

What did we learn from this Assignment >
	How to apply proper and specific checks for 0 condition and how to use tools like GitHub for a simple project.
